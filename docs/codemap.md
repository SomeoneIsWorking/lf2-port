# LF2 port — codemap

Static-recompilation port of Little Fighter 2 v2.0a (Marti Wong / Starsky Wong, freeware)
from 32-bit x86 Windows to native Linux/macOS.

Status legend: **done** (verified on real data) · **wip** · **planned** · **⛔ hack**

## Subsystems

| Subsystem | Where | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Installer unpacking | `tools/unpack_installer.py`, `tools/extract_game.py` | **done** | 690 files reconstructed; verified by booting the game from the output |
| Ghidra recon | `tools/ghidra/ListFunctions.java`, `re/functions.tsv` | **done** | 352 functions, 93.6% of `.text` |
| Wine oracle | `scratch/wineprefix` | **done** | boots headless under Xvfb to the main menu |
| Boundary tracer | — | **planned** | log every DDraw/DSound/winmm/USER32 call the game makes |
| Recompiler (x86 → C) | — | **planned** | test-first; decoder before lifter |
| Runtime (SDL3) | — | **planned** | video / audio / input / Win32 shim |
| Overrides | — | **planned** | controller hotplug, borderless |
| Netplay | — | **dropped** | stock lockstep netcode not ported; replace later |

## The binary

`game/lf2.exe` — PE32 i386, MSVC 2005, **unpacked** (no packer), image base `0x400000`.

| Section | RVA | Size | |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.text` | `0x1000` | `0x4530a` (284 KB) | 352 functions |
| `.rdata` | `0x47000` | `0x56c0` | |
| `.data` | `0x4d000` | `0xc724` | |
| `.rsrc` | `0x5a000` | `0x2f42f0` (3 MB) | dominates file size |

Code is dominated by monoliths — largest functions are 28 KB, 20 KB, 18 KB, 15 KB
(`FUN_0041bc90`, `FUN_004246b0`, `FUN_00429730`, `FUN_0042e100`). These are the main loop
and character state machine. **Static recompilation exists specifically so we never have to
hand-port these.**

## Platform boundary (the entire porting surface)

Only ~130 imported symbols. This is what the runtime must implement:

| DLL | Imports | Replacement |
|---|---|---|
| `DDRAW` | `DirectDrawCreate` **only** | our own COM vtables → SDL3 GPU |
| `WINMM` | `joyGetNumDevs`, `joyGetDevCapsA`, `joyGetPosEx`, `joySetCapture`, `joySetThreshold`, `timeGetTime`, `mmio*` | SDL3 gamepad; **the legacy joystick API is why hotplug does not work today** |
| `DSOUND` | ordinal #1 (`DirectSoundCreate`) | our own COM vtables → SDL3 audio |
| `USER32` / `GDI32` | window, message pump, `StretchBlt` | SDL3 window; `StretchBlt` is the scaling path → borderless |
| `WSOCK32` | 19 ordinals | **stubbed**, netplay dropped |
| `WININET` | 4 | stub (online version check / ad banner) |
| `MSVCR80` / `MSVCP80` | 60 | host libc / C++ stdlib |
| `COMDLG32`, `SHELL32`, `ole32` | 4 | file dialog, URL open, COM init |

**Design consequence:** `DirectDrawCreate` is the only DDraw import, so every other video
call reaches the game through a COM vtable the recompiler cannot resolve statically. The
runtime supplies those vtables. Same for DirectSound.

## Data layer

The game is heavily data-driven — `game/data/data.txt` indexes 40+ `.dat` object files
(characters, weapons) plus 183 WAVs. The `.dat` files are **encrypted**; the decryption
routine lives in the exe and is not yet located. Character frame data lives in these files,
not in code, which is why the exe is as small as it is.

## Installer container format

The v2.0a installer is a Win32 stub with a custom overlay (not Inno/NSIS):

```
'wwgT' + id + u16
script records:  comp_size u32, uncomp_size u32, method u8, stream
                 (comp_size covers method byte + stream + 4-byte trailer)
                 record 5 is the file table
file payload:    method u8, stream   -- repeated back to back,
                                        NO per-file lengths, NO trailer
```

Streams are zlib (method 1) or bzip2 (method 2); boundaries are recovered from the
decompressors' `unused_data`. File-table entries are length-prefixed: comp size at `+10`,
uncomp size at `+18`, NUL-terminated path at `+62`.

**Trap:** the installer stores each distinct file once. 17 table entries are duplicates that
reuse an earlier blob (e.g. `bg/template/2/pic2.bmp` is byte-identical to `template/1`'s).
A naive sequential name↔blob pairing misaligns and silently writes wrong content.
